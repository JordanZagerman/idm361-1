## Critiques

Critiques are opportunities to learn and share what you‚Äôve learned through demonstration and constructive criticism. When you present your work, you must be prepared to discuss it and address any questions concerning it. You should also take whatever criticisms you receive from faculty or students intent in which they are given, which is for you to improve. If you‚Äôre not presenting, it is expected that you give the presenter and their work your undivided attention and you are encouraged to ask questions, offer opinions and suggestions for improvement. You must take advantage of critiques for self improvement as an artist, and your participation in critiques will contribute to your class participation grade. Weekly assignments will be critiqued in class, as will the final project.
Add, Drop and Withdrawal Policies

During the pre-enrollment period through the end of the second week of classes for the term, all students, with the exception of 1st term freshmen, may add courses that are free from restrictions/permissions, by using BANNER Web for Students. See http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_add.asp

If you add this course after the start of the term, you are responsible for completing ALL work that you may have missed.

For both graduate and undergraduate students, courses may only be dropped during the ‚Äúdrop period‚Äù lasting from the beginning of the enrollment period through the end of the second week of the quarter. Dropping a course results in the course being removed from the student‚Äôs academic record without a ‚ÄúW‚Äù appearing on the transcript‚Äîspecifically, neither the course nor the grade of ‚ÄúW‚Äù appears on the student‚Äôs transcript. See http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_drop.asp

Drexel University allows students to drop a course through the end of the sixth week of the term. This means that you will not be allowed to drop a course, even if you are failing, after the sixth week of the term. The number of times you have already been absent, the status of your lab hours and, above all, the result of your midterm testing and other evaluations (chapter tests, quizzes, homework) are therefore your best guide to decide whether or not you should drop the course. See http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/pdf/course_withdrawal.pdf

By placing his/her name on work submitted for credit, the student certifies the originality of all work not otherwise identified by appropriate acknowledgments. Plagiarism covers unpublished as well as published sources. Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:
- Quoting another person‚Äôs actual words, complete sentences or paragraphs, or an entire piece of written work without acknowledgment of the source
